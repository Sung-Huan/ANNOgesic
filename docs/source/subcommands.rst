.. _ANNOgesic's subcommands:

ANNOgesic's subcommands
=======================

In general, the subcommands need at least one argument - the analysis
folder. If it is not given, ANNOgesic assumes the current
folder as the analysis folder. All the default settings were tested 
on several different organisms and produced in general good results. 
A user can perform an analysis rather easily which those default values 
and step-wise adapt the parameters to optimize the results if needed.

.. _The format of filename:

The format of filename
----------------------
In order to recognize file types as well as relation of genome name and features, 
please use following principle of filename designation:

The genome filenames should be the same as the annotation file designation, i.e.
``NC_007795.fa, NC_007795.gff, NC_007795.ptt, NC_007795.rnt, NC_007705.gbk``.

For all input gff files for ANNOgesic please use following format:
``$GENOME_$FEATURE.gff``. For an example, ``NC_007795_TSS.gff, NC_007795_transcript.gff``.

Possible feature names are:

===============  ===========================
Feature name     meaning
---------------  --------------------------- 
TSS              transcription starting site
processing       processing site
transcript       transcript
sRNA             small RNA
sORF             small open reading frame
term             terminator
5UTR             5'UTR
3UTR             3'UTR
circRNA          circular RNA
riboswitch       riboswitch
RNA_thermometer  RNA_thermometer
CRISPR           CRISPR
===============  ===========================

Please avoid ``|`` in the filename and genome name of Gff3 files or fasta file.

.. _The input format of libraries for running ANNOgesic:

The input format of libraries for running ANNOgesic
---------------------------------------------------

Some ``ANNOgesic`` modules require certain library information. Please use following format:

``$LIBRARY_FILENAME:$LIBRARY_TYPE:$CONDITION:$REPLICATE:$STRAND``

``$LIBRARY_FILENAME`` means the ``.wig`` file.

``$LIBRARY_TYPE`` can be ``tex`` (TEX+) or ``notex`` (TEX-) or ``frag`` (fragmented/conventional).

``$CONDITION`` is the index of conditions. Please use 1, 2, 3, ... to represent different conditions.

``$REPLICATE`` is the index of replicates. Please use a, b, c, ... to represent different replicates.

``$STRAND`` is the strand of wiggle file. Please use + or -.

All libraries should be seperated by colons and listed in one line, like shown in the example above, i.e.
for TEX +/- treated libraries:

::

  TSB_OD_0.2_TEX_reverse.wig:tex:1:a:- \
  TSB_OD_0.5_TEX_reverse.wig:tex:2:a:- \
  TSB_OD_0.2_TEX_forward.wig:tex:1:a:+ \
  TSB_OD_0.5_TEX_forward.wig:tex:2:a:+ \
  TSB_OD_0.2_reverse.wig:notex:1:a:- \
  TSB_OD_0.5_reverse.wig:notex:2:a:- \
  TSB_OD_0.2_forward.wig:notex:1:a:+ \
  TSB_OD_0.5_forward.wig:notex:2:a:+

or for fragmented libraries (RNA-Seq generated after transcript fragmentation):

::

  fragmented_forward.wig:frag:1:a:+ fragmented_reverse.wig:frag:1:a:-

If only conventional RNA-seq data without fragmentation or TEX treated can be provided, 
it can still be assigned to fragmented libraries. However, it may influence the results.

log file for storing the details of each module
-----------------------------------------------

If the user needs to check the details of the running of each module, ``log.txt`` can 
be found in the output folder of each module. These files include the full paths of the 
external tools, the required versions of the tools, the running commands of the tools and 
the full paths of the output files.

.. _create:

create (create analysis folder)
-------------------------------

``create`` generates the folders for analysis. Once created, please move the required files 
into the corresponding folders.

The folders are following:

**input:** Stores all input files.

	**BAMs:** For ``.bam`` files. ``BAMs_map_related_genomes`` 
	is for the ``.bam`` files which are mapped on closely related genomes of the reference genomes.
	``BAMs_map_reference_genomes`` is for the ``.bam`` files which are mapped on the reference genomes.

                            140 (average read depth * 3). Based on the same
                            example, if this value is r_10,a_3, the minimum read
                            depth will become exact 10 reads. If "none" is
                            assigned, read depth will not be considered. Default
                            is n_10,none.
      --ploidy {haploid,diploid}, -pl {haploid,diploid}
                            The query genome is haploid or diploid. Default is

      --rg_tag, -R          For one BAM file which includes multiple samples
                            (opposite of --ignore-RG in samtools). Default is
                            False.
      --caller {c,m}, -c {c,m}
                            The types of caller - consensus-caller or
                            multiallelic-caller. For details, please check
                            documentation of bcftools. "c" represents consensus-
                            caller. "m" represents multiallelic-caller. Default is
                            m.
      --dp4_cutoff DP4_CUTOFF, -D DP4_CUTOFF
                            The cutoff of DP4. The format is
                            $MIN_SNP_READS_NUMBER:$MIN_SNP_READS_RATIO.
                            $MIN_SNP_READS_NUMBER can be assigned by three types:
                            1. fix number ("r"), 2. times of the number of bam
                            files (counted from --bam_files) ("n") or 3. times of
                            average read depth ("a"). For example, n_10,0.8. If
                            the BAM files are 4, it means the minimum mapped reads
                            of a SNP is 40 (4 * 10), and the minimum ratio of
                            mapped read of a SNP (mapped reads of a SNP / total
                            reads) is 0.8. Default is n_10,0.8.

                            number of bam files (assigned by --bam_files) ("n") or
                            3. times of the average read depth ("a"). The input
                            format is $MIN_IDF:$MIN_IMF. For example, The value is
                            n_10,0.8 and 4 BAM files are assigned. The minimum IDV
                            is 40, and the minimum IMF is 0.8. Default is
                            n_10,0.8.

- **Output files**

If ``bam_type`` is ``related_genome``, 
the results will be stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/SNP_calling/compare_related_and_reference_genomes``. 
If ``bam_type`` is ``reference_genome``, the results will be stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/SNP_calling/mutations_of_reference_genomes``.

The output folders and results are following:

**SNP_raw_output:** Stores output tables which be only considered read depth and QUAL.

	**VCF Table (only consider read depth and QUAL):** Filename is ``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_$SET.vcf``.

**SNP_table:** Stores two types of output tables

        **VCF Table (consider all filters):** Filename is ``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_$SET_best.vcf``.

        **Index of fasta files:**: Filename is ``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_$SET_seq_reference.csv``.
        The meaning of this file is like following example:

::

  Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003     1632629 .       AaA     AA      57      .
  Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003     1632630 .       aA      a       57      .
  Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003     1499572 .       T       TT,TTTTT        43.8525 .

The example contains ``position conflict`` and ``mutation conflict``.
As a result, the conflicts will affect the other mutation's positions.
Therefore, it will generate four different fasta files. The first two lines are ``position conflict``, and 
the last line is ``mutation conflict``.
``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_$SET_seq_reference.csv`` is the index for these four fasta files.

::

   1       1632629 1       1499572:TT      Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003
   1       1632629 2       1499572:TTTTT   Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003
   2       1632630 1       1499572:TT      Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003
   2       1632630 2       1499572:TTTTT   Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003

The first column is the index of the ``position conflict``. 
The second column is the selected position.
The third one is the index of the ``mutations conflict``. 
The fourth one is the selected position and nucleotides. 
The last column is the genome name.

**Potential fasta files**: Filename is ``$FASTANAME_$SET_$STRIANNAME_$INDEXofPOSITIONCONNFLICT_$INDEXofMUTATIONCONFLICT.fa``, 
and it is stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/SNP_calling/$BAM_TYPE/seqs``.
Based on the example in **Index of fasta files**, ``Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003_set1_Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003_1_1.fa``
will be generated based on the first line of ``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_seq_reference.csv``.
``Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003_set1_Staphylococcus_aureus_HG003_1_2.fa`` and will be generated based on the second line of 
``$GENOME_$PROGRAM_seq_reference.csv`` and so forth.

**statistics**: Stores the statistic files and figures, ex: the distribution of SNPs based on QUAL.

.. _tss_ps:

tss_ps (TSS and processing site prediction)
-------------------------------------------

``tss_ps`` can generate the TSS and processing sites via running  
`TSSpredator <http://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/?page_id=190>`_. Since the parameters can affect the 
results strongly, ``optimize_tss_ps`` can obtain the optimized parameters of 
`TSSpredator <http://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/?page_id=190>`_. Please check the section 
:ref:`optimize_tss_ps` for details.

transcript (transcript detection)
---------------------------------

``transcript`` can detect transcripts based on the coverage. Most of the transcript assembly tools are
focus on eukaryotic transcript. Due to this, we constructed a subcommand which is based on the nucleotide coverage data, 
given gene annotations and several parameters that can be set by the user.

- **Required files**

**Wiggle files of fragmented/conventional libraries or TEX+/- treated libraries:** For importing the information about libraries, please check the section 
:ref:`The input format of libraries for running ANNOgesic`.

- **Optional input files**

**TSS gff files:** If the user wants to compare transcripts with TSSs, TSS gff files are required. Please check the section :ref:`tss_ps`.

**Gff files of genome anntations containing CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, etc:** If the user wants to compare transcripts with genome annotations or modify transcript based on genome annotations 
like CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, genome annotation gff files are required. There are four options for modification of transcripts:

	**merge_overlap:** If multiple transcripts overlap the same gene, they will be merged as one complete transcript.

	**extend_3end:** If the transcript starts at the upstream of the gene and ends within the gene, 
	the end point of the transcript will be extended to the end point of gene.

	**extend_5end:** If the transcript starts within the gene and ends at the downstream of gene, 
	the starting point of the transcript will be extended to the starting point of the gene.

        **within_extend_ends:** If the transcript is within the gene, the two ends of the transcript will be 
	extended to the two ends of gene.

	**none:** Transcripts will not be modified by the genome annotations

terminator (terminator detection)
---------------------------------

``terminator`` will predict the rho-independent terminators. ``ANNOgesic`` combines the results of 
two methods in order to get more reliable candidates. The first method is using `TranstermHP <http://transterm.cbcb.umd.edu/>`_.
The other one detects the specific secondary structure between converging pairs  
of transcripts and CDSs. ``ANNOgesic`` can check the coverages in order to generate the terminators 
which have coverage significant decrease.

- **Required tools**

`TranstermHP <http://transterm.cbcb.umd.edu/>`_

**RNAfold** of `ViennaRNA <http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/>`_.

- **Required files**

**Gff files of the genome annotations containing CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, etc**

**Fasta files of the genome sequences**

**Wiggle files of TEX +/- treated libraries or fragmented/conventional libraries**

                            assigned by 2) or can be detected in only one library
                            (TEX+ or TEX-, assigned by 1). Please assign 1 or 2.

	``low`` means the lowest coverage of the libraries, and ``diff`` represents the difference between ``high`` and ``low``. If ``No_coverage_decreasing`` is showed, 
	it means this terminator reveal gene expression but no coverage decrease. If ``NA`` is showed, it means that this terminator has no gene expression.

.. _utr:

utr (UTR detection)
-------------------

``utr`` can compare TSSs, CDSs/tRNAs/sRNAs, transcripts and terminators
to generate 5'UTR and 3'UTR. 5'UTRs are based on detecting the regions between TSSs and CDSs/tRNAs/sRNAs. 
3'UTRs are based on detecting the 
regions between the end of the transcripts and CDSs/tRNAs/sRNAs. If the input gff files of TSSs are not computed by 
ANNOgesic, please use ``--tss_source`` to classify TSSs for the analysis.

- **Required files**

**Gff files of the genome annotations containing CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, etc**

**Gff files of the TSSs**: Please check the section :ref:`tss_ps`.

**Gff files of the transcripts**: Please check the section :ref:`transcript`.

- **Optional input files**

**Gff files of the terminators:** If the information of terminators is needed, the gff files of terminators are required. Please check the section :ref:`terminator`.

- **Output files**

Output files of 5'UTRs are stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/UTRs/5UTRs``.

Output files of 3'UTRs are stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/UTRs/3UTRs``.

The output folders are as following:

**gffs:** Stores gff files of the 5'UTR/3'UTR. 
Some useful information can be found in the tags of the attributes within the UTR gff file. 
Based on this information, we can know the details of the specific UTR. The tags are as following:

	**length:** UTR length.
	
	**associated_cds:** Which CDSs/rRNAs/tRNAs are associated with this UTR.
	
	**associated_gene:** Which genes are associated with this UTR.
	
	**Parent:** Shows the parent transcript of this UTR.
	
	**associated_tss:** Which TSSs are associated with this 5'UTR.
	
	**tss_type:** What types of TSSs are associated with this 5'UTR.
	
	**associated_term:** Which terminators are associated with this 3'UTR.

**statiatics:** ``$GFFNAME_$GENOME_$UTRTYPE_length.png`` is the distribution of the UTR length.

.. _srna:

srna (sRNA detection)
---------------------
``srna`` can predict different types of sRNAs. For intergenic and antisense sRNA, it 
is detected via comparison of the transcripts and annotation profiles, as well as coverage files. 
For UTR-derived sRNA, the detection is based on the TSSs, processing sites, 
transcripts, genome annotations and coverage files. Further filters like folding free energy change, 
BLAST to nr database and sRNA database can be set as well.

- **Required files**

**Gff files of the genome annotations containing CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, etc**

**Gff files of the transcripts**: Please check the section :ref:`transcript`.

**Wiggle files of the fragmented/conventional or TEX+/- libraries:** Please check the section 
:ref:`The input format of libraries for running ANNOgesic`.

- **Optional input files**

**Gff files of the TSSs:** If you want to detect the UTR-derived sRNAs, it is necessary to input
TSS information. If you don't want to detect UTR-derived sRNAs, TSS information still can be provided as a filter.
We strongly recommend input this file. please check the section :ref:`tss_ps`.

**Gff files of processing sites:** For checking the sRNAs which end with processing sites. Moreover,
Some 3'UTR-derived and interCDS-derived sRNA candidates start
from processing sites not TSSs. If you don't want to detect UTR-derived sRNAs,
This information still can be provided to increase the accuracy, especially for some
long non-coding regions. We strongly recommend input this file if you want to detect UTR-derived sRNAs.
Please check the section :ref:`tss_ps`.

**Promoter tables:** Information of the promoter motifs can be used for prioritizing sRNA candidates via 
promoters and sRNA coverage. The format should be as following:

===========  ============  ==========  =======
Genome       TSS_position  TSS_strand  Motif
-----------  ------------  ----------  -------
NC_000915.1  237118        \-          MOTIF_1
NC_000915.1  729009        \-          MOTIF_1
===========  ============  ==========  =======

First irow is header of the table, the last column is the name of promoter motif.
If subcommand ``promoter`` was implemented before, the table will be generated automatically.
Please refer to the section :ref:`promoter`.

- **Filters with the corresponding input files and tools**

There are some filters which can improve the prediction. The user can assign the information to remove false positive. 
If the information is not assigned to be a filter, it still can input to the module. Then, the information will 
be shown in the output files, but this information is not considered as a filter. For an example, if terminator association 
is not assigned to be a filter, the user still can specify the path of terminator gff files. The associated terminators 
will be shown in output gff files and tables, but the sRNA candidates which are not associated with terminators will 
still be included. Following is the filter names with the required files and tools.

**Secondary structure:** Remove the false positive by checking the folding energy change of secondary structure.

	**Required tools:**

		`ViennaRNA <http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/>`_

	**Required files:**

		**Fasta files of genome sequences**

**TSS:** Remove the candidates which are not associated with TSSs.

	**Required files:**

		**Gff files of TSSs**

**Searching sRNA candidate in sRNA database:** If homology of this sRNA candidate can be found in sRNA database, 
this candidate will be included to the result without considering other filters. ``--blast_score_srna`` 
and ``--blast_e_srna`` can be used for adjustment of the prediction.

	**Required tools:**

		`Blast+ <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/>`_

	**Required files:**

		**sRNA database:** Such as `BSRD <http://www.bac-srna.org/BSRD/index.jsp>`_. 
		Format of the header should be ``$ID|$GENOME|$SRNANAME``. For an example, 
		``srn_4840|S._aureus_NCTC8325|RsaOV`` The ID is srn_4840, 
		the strain of this sRNA is S._aureus_NCTC8325 and the name of sRNA is RsaOV.
		If the format of the header is not correct, an error or non-sense results will occur.
		If you want to use BSRD with proper headers, you can download it from our
		`Git repository <https://github.com/Sung-Huan/ANNOgesic/tree/master/database>`_ easily.


**Searching sRNA candidate in nr database:** If homologs of this sRNA candidates can be found in nr database and the hit numbers are more than ``--cutoff_nr_hit``,
this candidates will be removed. ``--blast_score_nr`` and ``--blast_e_nr`` can be used for adjustment of the prediction.

	**Required tools:**

		`Blast+ <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/>`_

	**Required files:**

		**nr database:** The file can be download from `nr database <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/>`_.
	
**Terminator:** Remove the candidates which are not associated with terminators.

	**Required files:**

		**Gff files of the terminators**: Please check the section :ref:`terminator`.

**sORF:** Remove the candidates which overlap sORF.

	**Required files:**

		**Gff files of the sORFs**: Please check the section :ref:`sorf`.

**Promoter:** Remove the candidates which are not associated with promoter motif.

	**Required files:**

		**Tables of the promoters:** Please check the Promoter Tables of this section and the section :ref:`promoter`.

.. _sorf:

sorf (sORF detection)
---------------------
``sorf`` can detect sORF based on searching ribosome binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequence), 
start codons and stop codons within the non-coding expressed regions.
Since these regions may be sRNAs or sORFs, Comparison between sORFs and sRNAs can be done by this subcommand as well. 
If multiple sORFs overlap with each other, this subcommand will merge them to be one sORF. Therefore, one region may contain more than one sORF. 
Position of the start codon which listed in output table is assigned by the first nucleotide. The position of stop codon is assigned by the last nucleotide. 
Moreover, one region may contain different frame shifts. 
Ex: (200, 202, 203) are the positions of three start codons and (241, 243) are two stop codons in 
a small transcript. There are three sORF candidates (200-241, 203-241 and 202-243).

.. _promoter:

promoter (Promoter motif detection)
-----------------------------------

``promoter`` can scan the upstream of TSSs to discover the promoter motifs.
We integrated `MEME <http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme>`_ (for ungapped motifs) and 
`GLAM2 <http://meme-suite.org/tools/glam2>`_ (for gapped motifs) to predict the promoters.
Based on the tool, HTML files can be generated for visualization. If the input TSS gff file 
is not computed by ANNOgesic, please add ``--tss_source`` to classify TSSs for predicting  
promoter motifs.

- **Output files**

Output files are stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/promoters``. The output folders are following:

**allfasta:** If ``--combine_all`` is True, it will combine all TSS files in ``--tss_files`` 
to generate promoter motifs. The results will be stored in this folder.

**fasta_classes:** The fasta files of different TSS types.

**$GENOME_NAME:** Stores output of MEME and GLAM2 based on different TSS types. Two sub-folders are under this folder.

	**MEME**: Stores the results of MEME.

	**GLAM2**: Stores the results of GLAM2.

	The format of folders which under these two folders is ``promoter_motifs_$FILENAME_$GENOME_$TSSTYPE_$PROMOTERLEGNTH``,
	ex: ``promoter_motifs_NC_000915.1_allgenome_internal_45_nt``.
	``NC_000915.1``, ``allgenome``, ``primary`` and ``45_nt`` are gff filename, genome name, TSS type and upstream nucleotides of TSS, respectively.
	If genome name is ``allgenome``, this means that the result is generated by the information of all genomes of gff files. 
	If there is only one genome in the gff file, the genome name will be assigned as ``allgenome`` as well. Several files are stored in the sub-folder:
	
		**Figures of the promoter motifs:** Contains EPS and PNG files.
	
		**Details of the promoter motifs:** Contains HTML file, XML file and TXT file. These files include the TSS information.
	
		**Promoter tables:** ``meme.csv`` or ``glam2.csv`` is the promoter table which also includes the TSS information. 
		Moreover, it can used as an input for sRNA detection (``srna``). Please check the section ``srna``.

**TSS_classes:** If the TSSs are not computed by ANNOgesic, ``TSS_classes`` will be generated for classification of TSS.
TSS gff files with TSS types will be stored here.

.. _circrna:

circrna (circular RNA detection)
--------------------------------

``circrna`` can detect the potential circular RNAs via `Segemehl <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>`_. 
Moreover, the false positive can be removed by checking genome annotation files and quality of splicing site detection. 
The user can assign reads for detecting circular RNAs or assign BAM files to skip mapping.
BE CAREFUL, BAM files must be mapped by `Segemehl <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>`_ 
with ``--splits`` or ``circrna`` can't find the proper candidates.

- **Required tools**

`segemehl.x and testrealign.x in Segemehl <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>`_.
For generating testrealign.x, please refer to :ref:`Required tools or databases`.

- **Required files**

**Fasta files of reads or BAM files:** If you want to use BAM files directly, they should be 
mapped by `Segemehl <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>`_ with ``--splits``.
The input format is ``$SET_NAME:$READ1,$READ2,...`` or ``$SET_NAME:$BAM1,$BAM2,...``. 
For an example, ``set1:read1.fa,read2.fa`` means these two fasta files need to be computed together.
If your BAM files are generated by mapping reads on multiple reference genomes, 
`testrealign.x <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>`_ may not be able to 
handle them.

- **Output files**

Based on the programs (TSS/processing site), Output files are stored in 
``$ANNOgesic/output/TSSs/optimized_TSSpredator`` or ``$ANNOgesic/output/processing_sites/optimized_TSSpredator``. 
Two output files are as following:

**stat_$GENOME.csv:** Stores the information of every run. The first column is the number of run.
The second column is the parameter set. ``he`` represents height; ``rh`` represents 
height reduction; ``fa`` means factor; ``rf`` means factor reduction; ``bh`` indicates 
base height; ``ef`` indicates enrichment factor; ``pf`` means processing factor. About the details 
of parameters, please refer to `TSSpredator <http://it.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/?page_id=190>`_.
For an example, ``he_2.0_rh_1.8_fa_4.4_rf_2.8_bh_0.08_ef_3.0_pf_2.6`` means that height is 2.0, 
height reduction is 1.8, factor is 4.4, factor reduction is 2.8, base height is 0.08, 
enrichment factor is 3.0 and processing factor is 2.6. The third column is 
the number of true positive. The fourth column is true positive rate. The fifth 
columns is the number of false positive. The sixth is false positive rate. 
The seventh column is the number of false negatives. The eighth 
column is missing rate.

**best_$GENOME.csv:** Stores the best parameter set. The meanings of all columns are the same as ``stat_$GENOME.csv``.

                                    [--additional arguments]
    
    basic arguments:
      --project_path PROJECT_PATH, -pj PROJECT_PATH
                            Path of the project folder.
      --output_prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX, -op OUTPUT_PREFIX
                            The prefix name of output gff file. The file name will
                            be $OUTPUT_PREFIX_merge_features.gff.
      --transcript_file TRANSCRIPT_FILE, -a TRANSCRIPT_FILE
                            Path of transcript gff file. The parent transcripts
                            ("Parent" in gff attributes) of all features will be
                            generated.
      --other_features_files OTHER_FEATURES_FILES [OTHER_FEATURES_FILES ...], -of OTHER_FEATURES_FILES [OTHER_FEATURES_FILES ...]
                            Paths of the gff files (besides transcript gff file).
                            For assigning multiple gff files, please use spaces to
                            separate them.
      --source_for_overlapping SOURCE_FOR_OVERLAPPING [SOURCE_FOR_OVERLAPPING ...], -s SOURCE_FOR_OVERLAPPING [SOURCE_FOR_OVERLAPPING ...]
                            If the locations of features are overlapped, the
                            module will only keep the feature positions which
                            provided from --source_for_overlapping. For example,
                            if --source_for_overlapping is 'Ref' 'ANNOgesic', the
                            overlapping features from these two sources will be
                            both kept. However, if --source_for_overlapping is
                            'Ref', only the overlapping features from 'RefSeq will
                            be kept.' The value of --source_for_overlapping should
                            be the same as the second column of the gff file. if
                            all the sources of the overlapping features can not be
                            found in --source_for_overlapping, all the overlapping
                            features will be kept. Default is keeping all overlap
                            features.

- **Additional arguments**

    additional arguments:
      --terminator_tolerance TERMINATOR_TOLERANCE, -et TERMINATOR_TOLERANCE
                            The 3'ends of transcripts will be extended or withdrew
                            by this value (nucleotides) for searching the
                            associated terminators. Default is 30.
      --tss_tolerance TSS_TOLERANCE, -tt TSS_TOLERANCE
                            The 5'ends of transcripts will be extended or withdrew
                            by this value (nucleotides) for searching the
                            associated TSSs. Default is 5.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

- **Output files**

Output gff files are stored in ``$ANNOgesic/output/merge_all_features``. The tag - ``Parent`` in the attributes of 
gff file shows the parent transcript.
