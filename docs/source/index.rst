Introduction
=========================

ANNOgesic is the swiss army knife for RNA-Seq based annotation of
bacterial/archaeal genomes.

It is a modular, command-line tool that can integrate different types
of RNA-Seq data based on dRNA-Seq (differential RNA-Seq) or RNA-Seq
protocols that inclusde transcript fragmentation to generate high
quality genome annotations. It can detect genes, CDSs/tRNAs/rRNAs,
transcription starting sites (TSS) and processing sites, transcripts,
terminators, untranslated regions (UTR) as well as small RNAs (sRNA),
small open reading frames (sORF), circular RNAs, CRISPR related RNAs,
riboswitches and RNA-thermometers. It can also perform RNA-RNA and
protein-protein interactions prediction. Furthermore, it groups genes
into operons and sub-operons and reveal promoter motifs. It can also
allocate GO term and subcellular localization to genes. Several of
ANNOgesic features are new implementations while other build on well
known third-party tools for which it offers adaptive
parameter-optimizations. Additionally, numerous visualization and
statistics help the user to quickly evaluat feature predictions
resulting from an ANNOgesic analysis. The tool was heavily tested
with several RNA-Seq data set from bacterial as well as archaeal
samples.
